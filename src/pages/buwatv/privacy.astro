          <li><strong>Business Partners:</strong> We work with a number of business partners who help us offer Buwa Digital Services. We may share information collected from or about you with such business partners.</li>
          <li><strong>Affiliates:</strong> We may share your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Buwa Digital is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates").

          <li><strong>Third-Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you through our Services.
