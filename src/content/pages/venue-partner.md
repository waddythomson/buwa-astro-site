## Why Local Businesses Want to Join Our Network

### Network Advertising

One of the most enticing advantages of joining the network is that your motion ads will be showcased in nearby locations, enabling you to reach customers of other network partners. Some of these customers might also be yours, enhancing your brand awareness, increasing frequency, and sparking word-of-mouth referrals.

### Internal Advertising

Participating in the BuWa TV network also provides you with the opportunity to engage with your customers while they are inside your establishment. You can utilize screen time to inform, promote, or educate your customers about ongoing specials, promotions, or helpful tips.

### Content Creation

We handle all graphic content creation for our Network Partners. Just provide us with a few design elements, perhaps some images or video and the story you'd like to tell, and we'll take it from there.
