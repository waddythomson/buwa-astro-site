## Why Local Businesses Want to Join Our Network

### Network Advertising on BuWa TV

One of the most enticing advantages of joining the network is that you'll get free advertising in your location, and your full motion ads can be showcased in other locations, enabling you to reach customers in other network locations. This greatly enhances your brand awareness, helps you bring in new customers, sparks word-of-mouth referrals, and keeps your business top-of-mind.
