## SEM

Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is the umbrella term encompassing all digital marketing strategies aimed at increasing a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). It includes both organic methods, such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which focuses on optimizing website content and structure to improve unpaid search rankings, and paid methods, such as Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising. SEM aims to drive targeted traffic, increase brand visibility, and generate conversions through a combination of organic and paid search tactics.
