Display | Geofencing is suited for brands looking to increase Brand Awareness and visibility. If your goal is to generate leads, products such as [**Social Media Advertising**](/social-media-ads/) or [**Pay-Per-Click**](/pay-per-click-ppc/) will be a better fit. 

			 
			
				
				 
				   
				   
				   
				   
				   ### Can you place a fence around any location?

				  
				 
				   O
				   P
				   
				   
				 
				
				Location service restrictions may vary from state to state; however, federal law prevents the targeting of schools and medical facilities. Typically, businesses focus on their location and nearby areas to reach existing and potential customers. Another common practice involves fencing competitors' locations to attract similar customer demographics.
			 
			
				
				 
				   
				   
				   
				   
				   ### Can you target phone numbers?

				  
				 
				   O
				   P
				   
				   
				 
				
				

No. The industry adheres to specific privacy standards, and the only information collected is typically limited to what's known as a device ID or MAID.
